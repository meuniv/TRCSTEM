Dear Colleagues,

Today is my last day as editor and senior-editor of Carbon. I joined the team exactly 3 years ago. I did not see time fly and it was the most enriching experience for me!

As you may know, I’ve accepted Elsevier’s proposa to help with launching the new journal Carbon Trends (which started in October 2020). Starting tomorrow, I will focus all my attention to that journal. 

It was a great pleasure to work with you and I’ve to say that during the last 12 months as senior-editor, I did not receive any complaint from you! As you know Mauricio and I have been trying to balance the editors’ workload as fairly as possible. I know that Gareth, who will be taking over for me in the “senior-editor” role, will do the same. 

One key person I wish to thank is Mauricio. Under his leadership, Carbon has been steadily growing in quality and prestige. I know it will continue along the same trajectory. Of course, I would also like to thank Rosemary and Carla for their priceless help but also for their patience. Working with them is akin to acrobatic: you know you can do something stupid, they will also be there as a safety net to save the day!

I’m moving from a large team of experts and friends to a new job where I will initially be alone. That will be the hardest part! However, I know I will hear from you, at least indirectly, as I assess “transfers from Carbon” manuscripts in the new journal. 

It was a great pleasure working with all of you. I wish you a Happy New Year, with the hope that 2021 will be better than 2020. 

Best regards,

Vincent
